# Snek's Advanced Laydown System
A ChilloutVR's Laydown system. Animator based for maximum compatibility.

# Requirement's
Unity 2021.3.23f1
[The lastest CCK available](https://developers.abinteractive.net/cck/setup/)

# Setup
ChilloutVR's doesn't have an overly involved setup addon such a VRCFury, but honestly it's not really needed for this. Still, many new users might have difficulty understanding or even not knowing where/how to setup this, so I will explain it the best as I can below. There are 3 Main Parts, the Layer/Parameter setup - for the Animator setup, the Advanced Settings Menu Setup - for the ingame menu connection, and the Parameter Stream Setup - for the dynamic Parameters to work.

## Layer/Parameter Setup
UnderProgress - Writing it in batches, making it extremely clear

- Lazy Setup (Not Recommended, can cause issues with Parameter setups)

- Simple AAS Setup (Works and easy, can be destructive)

- RATS Setup (Recommended, simple, fast, failsafe, nondestructive)

# Addon Recommendation
You don't need this for the setup to work, but I highly recommend this addon's/extentions!

- [AASEmulator](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/AASEmulator/) a simple in Editor ChilloutVR's Advanced Avatar Settings emulator that let's you test your animation's and your Animator Logic rapidly and easily.
- [CCK.BaseAnimatorPatch](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/CCK.BaseAnimatorPatch) an alternative for ChilloutVR's base avatar animator that is easily extendable and with spot logic. (Also has some better animation configurations in my opinion :P )
- [SimpleAAS](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/SimpleAAS/) a simple Unity Animator Controller merger, best used to combine multiple animators into 1! Also incredibly useful when porting avatars from other platforms into ChilloutVR!
- The unfortunately named [RATS](https://github.com/rrazgriz/RATS/releases), or (üêÄ RATS - Raz's Animator Tweaks 'n' Stuff üßÄ) for it's extention and bugfixes of the Unity Editor (specifically the Animator editor, which still hasn't been properly bugfixed by Unity even on Unity 2021...)
- [Harmony for Unity Editor!](https://github.com/rrazgriz/harmony-vpm/releases/) repacked by Rrazgriz and the [legend of Brrainz](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) for originally making it - without their help modding Unity Games (and Editor) wouldn't be the same as we know it now.
